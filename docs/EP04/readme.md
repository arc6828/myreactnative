# EP 04 : STATE

1. Initialize State:

1. Create state variables to hold the necessary data in your component.
Set initial values for the state variables.
Display State Data:

1. Render the data from the state in your component's UI.
Access the state variables to display the relevant information.
Update State:

    - Implement functions or event handlers to update the state.
    - Attach event handlers to UI elements (e.g., buttons, input fields) to capture user interactions.
    - Modify the state variables using setState or useState hooks based on user actions or external events.
1. Pass State as Props:

    - If necessary, pass the state data as props to child components.
    - Ensure child components receive the required state information to display or update.
1. Handle Asynchronous Operations:

    - If your state involves asynchronous operations (e.g., API requests), handle them using promises, async/await, or callbacks.
    - Update the state variables accordingly when the asynchronous operation completes.

By following this outline, you can effectively manage state in your React Native component. Remember to customize the implementation based on your specific requirements and component structure.
